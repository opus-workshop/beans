  ## Context
  cmd_create requires either --acceptance or --verify, but parent/goal beans don't need either. The README and skill both show `bn create "Parent" --description "..."` which fails in practice.

  ## Task
  1. In src/commands/create.rs, only require acceptance/verify when the bean has no --parent and no children will be created (i.e., it's a leaf/spec bean)
  2. Actually, simplest fix: allow creation without verify/acceptance. The verify gate on close is what matters, not on create. Remove the bail.
  3. Add a test that creates a bean with only --description and no verify/acceptance

  ## Files
  - src/commands/create.rs (remove or relax the acceptance/verify requirement)

  ## Notes
  - The real gate is on close: bn close checks verify. Creating without verify just means the bean can't be auto-verified on close (which is fine for goals/parents).
  - Keep the helpful suggestion (Tip: Consider adding a verify command) but don't block creation.
