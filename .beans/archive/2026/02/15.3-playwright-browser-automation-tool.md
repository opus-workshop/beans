  Create a pi extension for browser automation via Playwright.

  ## Context
  The GUI tool uses screenshot→click coordinates which is fragile for web testing.
  Playwright provides reliable browser automation with proper selectors.

  ## Task
  1. Create extension at ~/.pi/agent/extensions/playwright/index.ts
  2. Add package.json with playwright dependency
  3. Register tools for:
     - browser_open(url) - open page
     - browser_click(selector) - click element
     - browser_type(selector, text) - type in input
     - browser_screenshot() - capture page
     - browser_content() - get page HTML/text
     - browser_evaluate(js) - run JS on page
  4. Manage browser lifecycle (lazy init, cleanup on shutdown)

  ## Files
  - ~/.pi/agent/extensions/playwright/index.ts
  - ~/.pi/agent/extensions/playwright/package.json

  ## Notes
  - Use headless by default, option for headed
  - Consider a single 'browser' tool with action parameter vs multiple tools
