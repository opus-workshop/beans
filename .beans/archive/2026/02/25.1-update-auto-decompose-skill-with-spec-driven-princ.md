  ## Contract

  Update `/Users/asher/.pi/agent/skills/auto-decompose/SKILL.md` to follow the Goal → Spec → Test framework.

  ## Required Changes

  1. **Reframe purpose**: Decomposition = clarifying goals into testable specs
  2. **Replace structural questions with spec questions** (contract, boundary, error, edge cases, test)
  3. **Update hierarchy terminology**: Parent=GOAL, Child=SPEC, Verify=TEST
  4. **Keep it autonomous** but spec-driven

  ## Reference
  Read `/Users/asher/.pi/agent/skills/decompose/SKILL.md` for the framework.
