  ## Contract

  Update `src/commands/claim.rs` to warn when claiming a bean without verify:

  ```
  Warning: Bean 3 has no verify command - this appears to be a GOAL, not a SPEC.

  Consider decomposing into child specs with: bn create "spec" --parent 3 --verify "test"

  Claim anyway? [y/N]
  ```

  Or in non-interactive mode, just print warning and proceed:
  ```
  Warning: Claiming GOAL (no verify). Consider decomposing first.
  Claimed bean 3: Add authentication
  ```

  ## File
  - src/commands/claim.rs

  ## Acceptance
  - Warning printed when claiming bean without verify
  - Does not block claim (just warns)
  - Suggests decomposition

close_reason: Implemented warning when claiming bean without verify. Added check in cmd_claim that prints warning via eprintln when bean.verify is None or empty whitespace. Warning message suggests decomposing. Added 4 tests to verify functionality.
