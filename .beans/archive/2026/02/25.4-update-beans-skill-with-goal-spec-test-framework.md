  ## Contract

  Update `/Users/asher/.pi/agent/skills/beans/SKILL.md` to incorporate the Goal → Spec → Test framework throughout.

  ## Current State

  The beans skill explains beans as a "task engine" focused on verification gates. It doesn't explicitly frame the hierarchy as Goal → Spec → Test.

  ## Required Changes

  1. **Add framework section early** explaining:
     - GOAL = parent bean (WHY - outcome we want)
     - SPEC = child bean (WHAT - contract, inputs/outputs, edge cases)
     - TEST = verify command (proves spec is met, TDD)

  2. **Update "Creating Beans" section**:
     - Clarify when you're creating a GOAL vs a SPEC
     - GOALs don't need --run (they need decomposition)
     - SPECs are what you --run

  3. **Update "Parent Beans" section**:
     - Reframe as "Creating Goals"
     - Goals get decomposed into specs
     - Link to decompose skill

  4. **Add guidance on spec questions**:
     - What's the contract?
     - What are the edge cases?
     - What test proves it works?

  ## Reference

  Read the updated decompose skill for the framework:
  `/Users/asher/.pi/agent/skills/decompose/SKILL.md`

  ## Acceptance
  - [ ] Goal → Spec → Test framework explained
  - [ ] Creating beans section clarifies goal vs spec
  - [ ] Guidance on when to use --run (specs only)
  - [ ] Links to decompose skill for goals
