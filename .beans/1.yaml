  Set up the Rust project structure for the `bn` CLI tool.

  ## What to implement

  ### main() — src/main.rs
  Entry point. Parse CLI args with clap, dispatch to command handlers.
  For now, all command handlers are stubs that print "not implemented".

  ### build_cli() — src/cli.rs
  Define the clap App with all subcommands and flags from the spec.
  Subcommands: init, create, show, list, update, close, reopen, delete,
  dep (add/remove/list/tree/cycles), ready, blocked, tree, graph, sync,
  stats, doctor.

  ## Files to create
  - Cargo.toml — binary crate `bn`
  - src/main.rs — main() dispatching to stub handlers
  - src/cli.rs — clap derive structs for all commands
  - src/lib.rs — module declarations (empty modules for now)

  ## Cargo.toml dependencies
  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "bn"
  version = "0.1.0"
  edition = "2021"

  [dependencies]
  clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
  serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
  serde_yaml = "0.9"
  chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
  anyhow = "1"
  ```

  ## Patterns
  - Use clap derive macros (#[derive(Parser)], #[derive(Subcommand)])
  - Each subcommand is a variant in a Subcommand enum
  - main() matches on the subcommand and calls the handler
  - For now, handlers just return Ok(()) or print "not implemented"

acceptance: |
  - `cargo build` succeeds
  - `bn --help` shows all subcommands
  - `bn init --help`, `bn create --help`, etc. show correct flags
  - Running any command prints "not implemented" or similar stub
